# pretty_feed

order pictures in current folder by dominant color. This is a standalone script with basics usecases.
It is upradable in a lot of ways :
- Complexity is O(n) you can easily make it better
- Algorith find the nearest color from the first color. So for the last iteration you just take whatever's left.
